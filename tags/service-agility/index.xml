The important Factors Driving NFV deployment is Service Agility &amp;amp; Flexibility
In a virtual environment, where applications are extracted from hardware, VNF de- signers face different challenges and opportunities. If operators are to achieve a step change in service agility, it should be possible to provision VNFs on a quasi-on- demand basis. Fit VNFs can be dedicated to a single function and then connected together using traffic steering (or &amp;ldquo;chaining&amp;rdquo;) mechanisms to create services.</description></item></channel></rss>
