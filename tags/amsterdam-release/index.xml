      <description>1st release Amsterdam release which is due to November 16
Critics  It will not be stable enough to be used for product
 misunderstanding  That release will focus on providing support for three network functions or services &amp;ndash; a virtual firewall (vFW), virtual customer premises equipment (vCPE) and a voice-over-LTE service running on a virtual evolved packet core (vEPC)
 I think this is a misunderstanding. These are just an use case not the ONAP supports them only.</description>
